It provides a clean interface, comment support, and an aesthetic bluish theme — all without using any backend.

🚀 Features

✅ Add comments under each post
✅ Delete existing posts
✅ Data saved using Local Storage (persists after refresh)
✅ Aesthetic gradient background with a hero image and fade-in animation
✅ Fully responsive and built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
